"Procedural" focuses on sequential instructions.

Declarative makes declarations and compiler relies on inference etc

functional makes all data immutable and uses mathematically pure functions

OOP is a paradigm focusing on data encapsulation.

"what are the important things"

what is an object?

objects represent entities "things" relevant in the context of the problem.
They can be anything.

objects have:

- attributes (fields, properties)
- methods

A board marker might have the attributes "colour", "nib type", "capacity",
"remaining ink", "manufacturer", etc..  Attributes are accessed by dot-notation
(like records) - board_marker.colour

importantly objects do not just have data but also encapsulate behaviours in
the form of methods (functions/procedures) - these are algorithms
